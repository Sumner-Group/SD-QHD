# SD-QHD
This is C++ code that will compute electron trajectories in molecular orbitals using spin-dependent quantum hydrodynamics (SD-QHD). The code assumes that the molecular orbitals are linear combinations of atom-centered, Cartesian Gaussian-type orbitals (GTOs). It requires that the wavefunction information is written in an AIMPAC WFX format.
